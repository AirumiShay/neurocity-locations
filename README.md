## 🛰️ ANNOUNCEMENT  
**INFINITY CYBERPUNK: NEUROCITY**

**In 2099, reality became an interface.**  
We’re not creating a game. We’re opening a portal.

A world where there is no truth — only layers of perception.  
Where virtuality fused with flesh, and mind — with the Network.  
Where everything you know about yourself may be a lie, coded into you by protocols.

**There are no heroes here. Only those brave enough to search.**

**Welcome to NeuroCity.**  
You won’t find a way out.  
Because you’re already inside.

## 🧠 PRESENTATION  
**NEUROCITY is not the world of the future. It’s its echo.**

Everything left of civilization has long dissolved into the Network.  
Laws were replaced by protocols.  
Emotions — by signals.  
Freedom — by illusion.

You enter as a user.  
But the deeper you go,  
the thinner the line becomes between you and the code.

What hides in the depths of the neurostreams?  
Who left clues in the ruins of old protocols?  
Why do some players see what others cannot?

**Code is the digital fabric of the Network.**  
Those who decipher it won’t just break through defenses —  
they’ll **rewrite virtuality itself — and perhaps, reality.**

**Are you ready to stop being human?  
To become the Network?**

## 🕶️ CALLING CARD

**Who are we?**  
No one knows who we are, or how many of us there are.  
Thinking like the Network, moving to its rhythm,  
we breathe in sync with its pulse.  
We don’t live in the Network.  
**We are the Network.**

**What are we creating?**  
It’s not a game.  
It’s a living, growing world hidden behind the interface.  
You may enter as a player.  
**But stay long enough — and you become part of it.**

**Where does it begin?**  
No one knows.  
But some already hear the Pulse.

**When?**  
The Pulse is quickening.  
**Follow the signal.**
